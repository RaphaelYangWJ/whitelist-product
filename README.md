#  Machine Learning Projects on GitHub: Whitelist Payment K-Means Aggregation Metrics Model

## Project Overview

This repository contains a Machine Learning (ML) project focused on monitoring customer metrics for payment transactions, specifically in the context of maintaining security and compliance. The project utilizes various ML techniques, including Regression, Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, Support Vector Machines (SVM), and Multilayer Perceptrons (MLP).

## Features

- **Customer Metrics Monitoring**: Analyzes customer's payment transactions from the past two years, calculating 36 different metrics such as transaction volume, income-expenditure ratio, and concentration of transactions. These metrics are monitored to identify any values that fall outside the safe zone, triggering detailed inspections to ensure transactional security and compliance.
- **K-Means Aggregation Metrics Model**: Implements a K-means clustering algorithm to categorize historical metric data into three groups. The model establishes safe and danger zones for each metric based on the 75th and 90th percentile of the centroid values, respectively. This automation significantly saves time and resources in setting these metrics.

## Usage

The model is encapsulated as software, providing an easy-to-use interface for the sales and product departments.
